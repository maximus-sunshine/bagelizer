# Trend Data Visualization App

Quickly visualize lots of trend data to gain engineering insights and make nice-looking graphs to include in 
reports/presentations. 

To get started, upload a .csv file with timestamps in the first column and trend data in the remaining columns - or 
click "See example"."""

        df.drop(df.columns[0], axis=1, inplace=True)  # !!! drop the first column of data so timestamps are in column
    fig = plot_time(df)

    """
    ### Raw Data (example):

    Uploaded file should be in .csv format with timestamps in the first column and trend data in the remaining 
    columns. This app supports a variety of timestamp formats, but the format should be consistent for all timestamps 
    in the uploaded file. Trend data columns should have meaningful titles. For best practice, use *lowercase*, 
    *lowercase_with_underscores*, or *camelCase* 

    Click "See example" again to see a different example.

    ### Point Trend Graph (example):
    
    Click on point names in the legend to make them visible.
    
    Pan and zoom with your mouse to get a closer look at the data. Double click inside the graph to reset the axes.
    
    You can download this graph as a .png by clicking the camera icon in the plot figure menu.
